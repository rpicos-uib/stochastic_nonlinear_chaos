Stochastic implementation of **Hindmarsh Rose** neuron model. 

The two main files are **hr_model_normal_1.m** (conventional arithmetic) and **hr_model_normal_1_s.m** (stochastic computing). Both are limited in the [-1,1] range, and a full description is inside the functions. 

They work with Matlab 2018b. The other files are just auxiliary functions to represent various results.
